# shelllings

## about
A practical way of learning shell through exercises.
This has a focus on a linux environment.
This is also mainly a way for me to learn shell as well so bugs and unoptimized code should be expected.

## installing and running

```
git clone https://github.com/davidvoz/shelllings.git
cd shelllings
sh run_me.sh
```
