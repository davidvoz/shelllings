# At this point, you have learned many commands that are used and you
# won't be able to remember them all at the top of your head. Instead of
# going into your notes on into this folder, use the '--help' 
# (sometimes '-h') to see the basic usage or the 'man' command to get
# a more detailed documentation
#
# $ cat --help    # displays a basic help message
# $ man cat       # enters you into a more detailed portal
#
# If there are more specific use cases or you only need a few commands
# that you keep forgetting, consider using the 'ffr' command located at
# https://github.com/davidvoz/toyotacorolla/blob/main/ffr
# For the linux users here, copy that code into .local/bin/ffr and add
# the line below to your .bashrc or .zshrc. Follow the instructions on
# the script and try it out.
#
# $ export PATH="$HOME/.local/bin:$PATH"
# 
# To keep this exercise simple, figure out how many lines the man page
# for cat uses, and the amount of words in ls's help command

echo "$amount_cat" # leave this unchanged
echo "$amount_ls"  # leave this unchanged
