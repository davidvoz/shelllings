# When you installed this program, it was written to 'cd' into this
# directory (folder). cd stands for change directory, when you cd'd
# into shelllings/ you changed into that directory. 
#
# $ cd foo/     # takes you into the foo folder
# $ cd ..       # takes you out of 1 upper folder
# $ cd ../..    # takes you out of 2 upper folders
# $ cd ~        # navigates to your user's home directory, may not
#                 work with all shells
# $ pwd         # shows you which folder path you are in
#
# The exercise will begin when you run 'sh shelllings.sh 3' and you
# will have to find a random folder. Navigate using the commands above
# to find a folder with a password in it. You may want to use the 'ls'
# command from the previous lesson.
#
# When you have found the file, use this command. Replace the file_name
# with the actual file's name if you cannot open it
#
# $ cat file_name
#
# Don't worry about deleting the newly created folders, it should be
# automatically deleted.
