# Assigning variables in shell go like this

# $ project="shellling"
# $ echo "Welcome to $project" # output: Welcome to shellling
#
# Notice that there are no spaces around the '=', and the '$' is being
# used in the echo command.

# Fix the command below

name = Bob
echo "Hello name" # this is a comment too, the program will ignore this
