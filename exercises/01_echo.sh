# To write the first shell command, see the other files that end with
# .sh and see what they have as their first line at the very top. Do 
# the same here.
#
# The first command you will learn is 'echo'. This is the same as printf
# or print or cout in other languages. To print a message, type echo, 
# and then surround the message with double quotation marks. 
#
# $ echo "Welcome to shelllings"
#
# The '$' symbol above is not needed, it is used to show you what is a
# command. As is custom, write your first Hello World program below
