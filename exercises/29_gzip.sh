# gzip (gunzip) is a GNU file compression and expansion tool that comes
# with most linux distrobutions. Use the --help option to know how to 
# compress the LICENSE file into a new file LICENSE.gz, leaving LICENSE 
# unchanged. If successful, don't worry about having to remove the .gz
# file, shelllings.sh will take care of that.
